# Intelligent-Traffic-Light-System-for-Four-Way-Junction-Using-ANFIS-and-Fuzzy-Logic

 Employed fuzzy logic to model the system, determining the sequence of the four lanes based on realtime traffic conditions detected through lane sensors. Implemented adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference 
system (ANFIS) to calculate the duration of green light for each lane. 
 Constructed a winning system using Arduino, configuring sensors as inputs and LEDs as outputs. 
This project secured first place in a competition.
